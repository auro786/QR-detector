# QR-detector

This project is designed to provide QR code detection and alert functionality using JAVA, incorporating an audio notification. The inspiration behind this project originated from a 
practical scenario encountered during online class attendance management. Attendance was taken via QR codes displayed randomly on the screen, posing challenges when 
the user was not actively looking at the screen or engaged in other tasks.

By implementing this solution, the application continuously monitors the screen for QR codes using computer vision techniques. 
Once a QR code is detected, the program triggers an audio notification, ensuring that the user is promptly alerted, even if they are not actively observing the screen.

This project aims to enhance efficiency and convenience during online activities that involve QR code-based interactions, 
offering a seamless attendance tracking experience in diverse virtual environments
